# 📈 Apple Stock Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **time-series forecasting of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock prices** using multiple statistical and machine learning models. The project fetches stock data from **Yahoo Finance**, preprocesses it, applies forecasting models, and deploys the results on an **interactive Streamlit dashboard**.

The aim is to compare different forecasting techniques and evaluate their accuracy.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 📊 Fetches Apple stock data using **yfinance**
* 🧹 Data preprocessing & handling missing values
* 🔮 Models used:

  * **ARIMA** (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
  * **SARIMA** (Seasonal ARIMA)
  * **Prophet** (by Facebook/Meta)
  * **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network)
* 📉 Model performance comparison using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
* 🌐 Deployment with **Streamlit** for interactive visualization

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* **Machine Learning/Deep Learning**: statsmodels, Prophet, TensorFlow/Keras
* **Streamlit** for deployment
* **yfinance** for data collection

## 📊 Results

* **ARIMA/SARIMA** captured short-term trends well.
* **Prophet** handled seasonality effectively.
* **LSTM** performed best in predicting stock price patterns.
* Evaluation Metric: **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

* Practical implementation of **time-series forecasting models**
* Understanding pros & cons of classical (ARIMA, SARIMA) vs modern (LSTM, Prophet) approaches
* Hands-on experience with **model evaluation & deployment**
